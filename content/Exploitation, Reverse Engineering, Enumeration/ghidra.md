# notes on interpretation:

double click on any variable or function name to go to it in the assembly

rename vars or functions when you know what they are
## DAT_ ...
in the decompiler, 
DAT_  indicates global variables....ghidra can't interpret them, so go to it in assembly and edit them ourselves, shows the actual characters / bytes in those addresses
and char is a byte, so change type to char\[n\]

double click on DAT__00400b48 to go to that data in the assmbly and see what kind of data it is... 

for example:
DAT_00400b48                                    XREF\[1]\:     main:004009ec(\*)  
00400b48                    ??         25h    %
00400b49                    ??         64h    d
00400b4a                    ??         00h

 you see its %d with a null pointer, so integer
